    "##  The Central Limit Theorem for the binomial distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, we focused on the binomial distribution, which describes discrete variables, as well as the Gaussian (aka normal) distribution, which describes continuous variables. One reason, among zillions, for why the Gaussian function is useful and ubiquitous is because of the Central Limit Theorem, which states that, under some mild assumptions, a sum of a large number of random variables (or, equivalently, the mean, which is just the sum divided by the number of variables) tends to be normally distributed, even if the variables themselves do not come from a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will show that the binomial distribution becomes a normal distribution when the number of samples becomes large. Recall that a variable $m$ drawn from the binomial distribution $\\mathrm{Bin}(m | N, \\mu)$ describes the number of observations in which a binary variable takes the value 1, given that there are $N$ total observations, and each observation gives 1 with probability $\\mu$ (or 0 otherwise). If we let $m=xN$, then $x$ is a random variable describing the fraction of observations in which 1 is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $x$ is an average of $N$ random binary variables, we expect the Central Limit Theorem to apply. In the two exercises that follow, we will show that $p(x) = \\mathrm{Bin}(xN | N, \\mu)$ becomes a normal distribution as $N \\to \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3a** (2 points): Use Stirling's approximation $\\ln N! \\approx N(\\ln N - 1)$ (valid for $N \\gg 1$) to show that $p(x) \\propto \\exp[N f(x)]$, where $f(x)$ is independent of $N$, and derive $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3b** (2 points). As $N \\to \\infty$, we can apply the method of steepest descent, which means that the exponential in $p(x)$ will be vanishingly small except for values of $x$ very close to the maximum of $f(x)$. Solve for $x^*$ which maximizes $f(x)$ and perform a Taylor expansion to second order, leading to $p(x) = \\exp[-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x - x^*)^2]$ (we aren't worried about the normalization in front of the exponent). What are $x^*$ and $\\sigma$? How are they related to the mean and variance of the binomial distribution that we started with? This relation turns out to be a general one, applying to other distributions as well as the binomial distribution.\n",
