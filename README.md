Homework assignments and other course materials for Math 607 Statistical Learning, University of Oregon, Winter 2026.

This page contains the syllabus, lecture demonstration code, and homework assignments for the class. Homework assignments should be submitted via Canvas. 

The notebook `PythonTutorial.ipynb` is a good place to get started for those who are relatively new to Python. It is not a graded assignment and does not need to be turned in, but is meant to provide some extra practice with basic Python programming to those students who feel that they could benefit from it.
